# Knights Travails

## Description

- All this does is demonstrate the usage of BFS given a graph that represents a 8 x 8 chess board (no GUI)
- With BFS and a given "knight", it calculates the shortest possible way to get to one square to another and outputs all the squares/co-ordinates the knight will stop along the way.
